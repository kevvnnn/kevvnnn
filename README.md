Di Gramedia cari buku<br>

Mohon yang baik-baik samaku<br>
Maaf brok sedang meratapi nasib<br>

  <summary>What's that ^^^ ?</summary>
  A <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantun>pantun</a>! It's an oral form of poetry in the Malayic language group, which includes Indonesian, my mother tongue.<br>
  It's particularly sublime for sharing with your special someone, bar the self-cringe.<br><br>
  
  Rougly translated, it means:<br>
  <i>In Gramedia find book<br>
  To Lautan Api watch Persib<br>
  Please be good to me<br>
  Sorry bro lamenting fate rn</i>

  Welp, it only works when it rhymes.<br>

## Heyy wsg gang 👏
I'm kevvnnn, a student learning how to aura farm in computer science with an AI specialization ts.<br>
I unfortunately live in Indonesia (not even Bali, mind you) 💀.<br>

so enjoy me glazing myself in this no cap goofy-ahh self-written lore drop.
